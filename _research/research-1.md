title: "Local Agentic Code Generation with Quantized LLMs"
collection: research
# category: projects
permalink: /research/local-agentic-codegen
excerpt: 'Developed a lightweight version of the CodeSIM framework optimized for local environments using 4-bit quantized models like Gemma-2-9B and CodeLlama-7B. Re-architected the original agent loop and prompt strategy to run efficiently under hardware and privacy constraints, while maintaining strong performance on HumanEval and other code generation benchmarks.'
