SwechaAP, Hyderabad, Telangana, India — Remote
======
**Role:** Software Developer Intern  
**Timeline:** June 2022 – August 2022

Overview
------
Worked on a planning tool to determine **where to place routers** for reliable connectivity in underserved regions. Combined a simple **web app** with **ML-driven scoring** so non-technical users could evaluate placement scenarios quickly.

Key Projects
------
- **Router Placement Optimizer**  
  Implemented data processing and scoring logic for candidate sites; exposed results through a web interface to compare configurations and trade-offs (coverage vs. cost).  

- **ML Modeling & Evaluation**  
  Used **pandas/NumPy** for feature prep and **scikit-learn** for model training and validation; visualized performance with **matplotlib** to guide iterations and highlight edge cases.  

- **Team Leadership & Delivery**  
  Coordinated a team of **11**, ran short sprints, handled task breakdowns/reviews, and maintained documentation for reproducible runs and onboarding.

What I Owned
------
- Core Python modules for data prep, scoring, and evaluation.  
- Web-facing endpoints and simple UI glue for scenario testing.  
- Experiment tracking, plots, and write-ups for stakeholders.  
- Team coordination (issues, reviews, and weekly checkpoints).

Tech Stack
------
**Python** (pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib), **Git/GitHub**, **Linux**, basic **web stack** (endpoints + UI).

Impact
------
- Delivered a practical tool that **streamlined router planning** for remote deployments.  
- Improved model quality through disciplined preprocessing and iterative validation.  
- Reduced onboarding time with clear docs and reproducible experiments.
